P38MAPKpathwayKb100K.Rdata contains 3 objects:
- Gn is a list of 99 genes from the P38MAPK pathway. Each gene is a list of 9 
  objects:
  1) n=373 gene expression levels
  2) matrix with between 56 and 1169 SNPs (0/1 coded)
  3) vector of start location [bits], end [bits] location and length of the gene 
  4) binary vector that indicates whether the SNP is in (1) or out (0) of the 
    gene
  5) vector with location [bits] of the SNP
- G2 is the training data
- G1 is the test data
- Annotation is from the GRCh37 reference genome
